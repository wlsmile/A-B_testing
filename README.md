## A-B_testing
### Cookie Cats is a mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment. It's a classic "connect three" style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color in order to clear the board and win the level. As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase. 
### The company is tring to figure out the impact of moving the first gate  from level 30 to level 40 on player retention.



### A/B test procedure 
#### 1. Objective of this A/B test: to decide wether moving the gate from level 30 to level 40 will affect players retention rate (both retention for 1 day and 7 days)

#### 1.5 Exploratory analysis

#### 2. Experiment Design
     Key metric: game rounds played and retention rate. 
     Decide minimum detectable effect(MDE)/Practical significance

     Unit of variant: 
     Control group: units belong to gate_30; Treatment group: units belong to gate_40

     Decide statistical power: 0.8; Significance level: 0.05
     Calculate sample size
     Decide how long to run the experiment

#### 3. Run parametric/non-parametric tests to detect the change and if the change is significant  

#### 4. Sanity/validity check

#### 5. Intepret the Result
